# Indonesia Paradise

## Inspiration
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Indonesia's tourism industry has been severe to maintain its operation, especially for the Small and Medium Enterprises and local tourist guides. While tourism plays a significant role and contributes to one of the main sources of foreign currency earnings. Not to mention that tourism provided 12.7 million jobs, representing 10.5% of total employment. Beyond these economic benefits, tourism builds links between people. It challenges stereotypes. It opens up new worlds and greater understanding. Unlike any other websites, apps, or articles that put more emphasis on how to sell their product or services, this app provides complete access (brief description, nearby food, hotel, accommodation, etc.) and comprehensive information from which tourists could know what kinds of places they should visit and what kinds of hotels they should stay in so they can make plans as soon as possible, providing the itinerary and other related services to promote a better experience of visiting Indonesia. As Indonesia pursues to thrive in the tourism industry beyond Bali and not all “hidden” tourism destination gets acknowledged and discovered, we could envisage a great opportunity for Indonesia's tourism actors to harness this chance to acquaint the world with the rich in culture, awash in natural beauty and warm with the hospitality of Indonesia. 

## What it does
IndonesiaParadise apps intend to help SMEs nearby popular and unpopular tourist destinations in Indonesia to expand their business by connecting all tourism actors’ markets and promoting their products or services to both travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) tourism. Equipped with built-in features to give a recommendation about the place to visit, forums for visitors to interact and/or find their travel partners, as well as preferred accommodations, this app will replace and improvise any other book, websites, or articles that may not be up to date and misleading in terms of the content. Furthermore, tourism actors can be more competitive with others by improving their embedded services and knowledge to serve their customers better leading to the development and discovery of an untouched part of Indonesia. In the long term, we expect to see our Bali numbers replicated across the archipelago and are optimistic that this app will not only standardize Indonesian tourism actors’ products and services but also exhibit the creativity and diversity of Indonesia’s culture and put them on the world stage.

## How we built it
We design simple and easy-to-use applications using travel blogs and travel guidebooks as our references. Build it using Flutter and Firebase to create the MVP. Find useful travel information to put inside the application and release it to the community so they can collaborate by adding more articles and recommendations including their business and services.

## Challenges we ran into
- Of all features that we list we need to pick which one is the MVP and gives the most benefit to the project.
- Deciding the tech stack we need to use to build the MVP in a limited time.
